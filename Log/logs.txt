2022-12-31 02:12:09,909 the shape of the traning dataset is 8523 , 12
2022-12-31 02:12:10,671 the shape of the test dataset is 5681 , 11
2022-12-31 02:12:12,760 there are some missing values in train and test dataset in item weight and outlet size
2022-12-31 02:12:13,529 lets start data cleaning....
2022-12-31 02:12:17,882  we successfully replace missing values with mean from the column Item Weight
2022-12-31 02:12:18,320 Outlet size columns is categorical column so we can replace with mode
2022-12-31 02:12:20,010  we successfully replace missing values with mode from the column Outlet size
